# Norm's NeoVim configuration

This is my personal NeoVim configuration. It's likely only really useful to me,
but if you see something here that you like, may use it under the terms of
the MIT License.

The colorscheme used here requires a console with modern color support.
I am using iTerm2. If you want to use plain old Terminal.app you'll want
to change the colorscheme to something else.

## Dependencies

```
# A better grep app, needed by some plugins
brew install ripgrep

# Ruby Lanauge server
gem install solargraph

# Lua language server
brew install lua-language-server

# Eslint, HTML, JSON and CSS language servers
brew install vscode-langservers-extracted
```
